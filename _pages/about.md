<p align="justify">My name is Pablo Ricardo Arantes, and I am a research scientist at the University of California Riverside, working in the field of biophysics. My research at the University of California focuses on molecular simulations of emerging genome editing technologies based on the CRISPR-Cas systems that was recently felicitated by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2020. To help understanding of these technologies, I have recently published the first computational study of the CRISPR-Cas12 system. I hold extensive expertise in computational biophysics and knowledge in state-of-art computational methods that have been proven instrumental in delving deep into biological function. During my PhD in Cell and Molecular Biology, I worked with different glycoproteins and glycoconjugates (Arantes et al., 2014), such as Antithrombin (Arantes et al., 2017). Also during my PhD, I worked in a project that developed a new parameter set for MD simulations of chalcones and flavonoids (Arantes et al., 2019) main scaffolds under GROMOS force field. </p>
